IN PASS BY VALUE,THE FUNCTION MAKES COPY OF THE ORIGINAL VARIABLE AND IS NOT ACESSING THE ORIGINAL VARIABLE

so if code is
passValue(vari);
void passValue(int x){
x=any value; //IT WILL ONLY CHANGE VALUE LOCALLY
}
THen value of vari is not going to change rather the value of x is going to change

IN PASS BYREFERNCE- WE PASS MEMORY ADDRESS
passRefer(&vari); //PASSING ADDRESS OF VARI
void passRefer(int *x){
//

*x=new value; //THIS WILL CHANGE VALUE AT MEMIRY ADDRESS of vari
}
